            Hey, my name is Salam Aboul Hosn. I am currently a third year
            student at the <i>University Of California, San Diego </i>studying
            <em>Mathematics and Computer Science</em>. I have taken a variety of
            courses such as advanced data structures, design & analysis of
            Mathematics and Computer Science algorithms, and object oriented
            programming allowing me to learn <strong>Java, C, and C++</strong>.
            I am an extremely self motivated individual and self taught
            <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Express, and MongoDB</b> by taking
            online courses with certification and building projects. I have 5
            months worth of professional experience as a front end developer in
            React & Typescript for Smart Twigs Consultancy Group building a full
            stack web app.

            <h3>Book Store</h3>
            <p>
              Developed front-end with React and server with Express allowing
              users to create, read, update & delete books. Integrated MongoDB
              as the database and used Mongoose to define data models and a
              schema to store book information efficiently. Leveraged Tailwind
              for a responsive UI and Axios for data fetching with a Node
              back-end.

            <h3>Game Hub</h3>
            <p>
              Displayed game data from RAWG Database API by using HTTP get
              requests and useEffect Hook. Responsive website design that adapts
              to devices such as phones, tablets, computers, etc. Created search
              bar component, saved its data with useRef, and sent it to the back
              end to look for searched data. Made custom hooks for organized and
              modular code. Deployed to production using vercel to allow users
              to look for their favorite games.

            <h3>To Do List</h3>
            <p>
              Allows users to add and delete daily tasks by storing them into an
              array. Utilized useState Hook to update the state of the UI using
              onClick Events. Incorporated Data Structures such as Map to add
              tasks and Filter to delete tasks from the array. Had clean and
              readable code by using the ES6 Spread Operator. Deployed to vercel
              increasing my productivity by 20%.
